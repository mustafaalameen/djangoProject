I created a a news reporter app where you can login if the the client is a user or sign up if not. After logging in
The user can create a news report, Delete news, comment and finally logout. Additionally, if a cleint forgets his or her 
Password he can reset it and the information sent to his email. I deployed the app on heroku.
And the App link is: https://mynewsreporterapp.herokuapp.com/
